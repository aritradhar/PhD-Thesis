A few months back, I was watching a video where former California governor and former bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger, delivering a speech at the graduation ceremony at University of Huston a few years back. He said that the concept of a self-made man or woman is a myth. No one is truly self-made, as one's journey is supported by countless help and kindness. I could not agree with this statement more, which is why I would like to take some time to thank so many people for my unforgettable Ph.D. journey.


The most significant impact during my Ph.D. was made by my adviser Dr. Srdjan Capkun both professionally and personally. I can not thank him enough for his continuous support and guidance throughout the past years. He gave me immense freedom to explore the topics that I am truly passionate about. He guided me when I did not know what to do with that freedom. Srdjan has a unique mentoring skill, and the way he creates bonds with his students always amazes me. I tried to imitate some of his techniques while supervising students. The numerous discussion I had with him, not only about my work but also my personal life, had a profound effect on my perspective on science, and life, in general.


Another person who has a significant impact on my Ph.D. was Dr. Kari Kostiainen. He was not only a frequent collaborator, but also he mentored me towards formulating my ideas and giving me feedback on my writing.  Kari's structured way of writing papers had a visible impact on all my writings. I remember knocking on his office door on numerous occasions whenever I had some new ideas. Even though most of the ideas did not make it out of his office, some of our papers resulted from these frequent brainstorming sessions. I was always amazed to see no matter how heated the discussions were; he was always calm and composed.


Dr. Rahul Purandare, my master's thesis adviser at IIIT-Delhi, had a significant influence on me for shaping my career path. Not only he gave me an abundance of freedom to work on my idea, but he also encouraged me to pursue a research career and supported me enormously. Joining the Ph.D. program at ETH is something that was a result of his continuous encouragement. Similarly, Dr. Pinaki Sarkar, my bachelor thesis adviser, had an impact on shaping my naive understanding of research. He took me under his wings to work beside him during his Ph.D. My fond memories of taking long walks with him to brainstorming combinatorics are something I cherish. I learned a great deal about critically think about the problems, relentlessly working and shaping ideas, and scientific writing.


During 2016, during the time of changing continent and moving to Z\"urich, I was afraid that it would be a stressful affair given how far away I would be from my family and life-long friends. However, I was extremely fortunate to create bonds and had a circle of friends and colleagues that gave me an essential lifeline. Undeniably, these bonds were essential to continue my research and life in Z\"urich. 


First, I would like to thank Mrs. Anne Messinger and her families for their immense kindness and humidity. I spend my first year in Z\"urich at their home at Wollishofen. They treated me like a family and reminded me that I have a second home here. 


During my stay at ETH and in the System Security group, I was fortunate to meet and become friends with some amazing people. I will start with Mridula Sing, whom I met during my masters at IIIT-Deli and also were my colleagues at Xerox research. Coming to Z\"urich, she was the only familiar face. Thanks to her and Saurav Bose, we had quite a lot of Indian food dinner sessions. All the weekend trips with them were an absolute pleasure. Special thanks to Dr. Sini\v{s}a Mateti\'c for being such a good friend and tolerating me while I was making fun of him countless times. During my Ph.D. interview, Sini\v{s}a appeared to be quite a grumpy personality. But getting to know him over the last five years revealed that my initial impression could not be more wrong. Thanks to David Sommer for a number of very philosophical discussions. His revolutionary ideas were breaths of fresh air, and our year-long collaboration on CoverUp during the beginning of my Ph.D. was a pleasure. Special thanks to Dr. Luka Mali\v{s}a for all the conversions we had. I always found him easy to talk to about my personal struggles, which are always the most difficult conversations. I thank Karl W\"ust for such a good friend. Traveling with him and Balz to Iceland was memorable. I was always amused to see how deep knowledge he had about many other things outside computer science. Calling his craft beer knowledge encyclopedic will be an understatement. Thanks to Daniele Lani for being a good friend and an amazing officemate for the last three years. Having long conversions over beers and board games at his apartment were some of the most enjoyable times I had. I am also thankful for the authentic Neapolitan pizza recipe that I got from him. Dr. Esfandiar Mohammadi is another person with whom I collaborated in the beggining or my PhD. Special thanks to him for mentoring me and helping me in the initial phase of my Ph.D. Special thanks also to Dr. Thilo Weghorn for being such a good friend. The trip with him to Japan and Taiwan was an amazing experience. Thanks to Dr. Marco Guarnieri for all the conversations and attention to detail while checking draft of my papers or this thesis. Thanks to Bhargav Bhatt for a good friend and a fantastic office mate for the first two years till I moved my office. Thanks to Daina Romeo for showing me how to cook gnocchi and participating in drawing overly aggressive shouting Pokemons\footnote{We called the pokemon differently though.}. Big thanks to Dr. Der-Yuan Yu for the collaboration in my earliest idea and for being such a fantastic friend. He was solely responsible for motivating me to come to the super Kondi and weight lifting session at the sports center. Thanks to Moritz and Ivan for being such amazing collaborates. I thank my colleagues  Prof. Dr. AanjhanRanganathan, Mansoor Ahmed, Dr. Claudio Marforio, Dr. Nikolaos Karapanos, Dr. Hubert Ritzdorf, Lara Schmidt, Patrick leu, Patrick Schaller, Dr. Marc Röschlin, Dr. Enis Ulqinaku, Dr. AbdelRahman M. Abdou, Dr. Arthur Gervais, Dr. Srdjan Krstic, Dr. Carlos Cotrini, and Dr. Ognjen Maric for making my journey memorable. Also, thanks to Christopher Signer for all the craft beer and board game sessions and for being such a kind and compassionate person. The Call of Duty gaming sessions with Chris, Daniele, Giovanni, Nodi, and Gianluca made the Covid lockdown during mid-2020 tolerable. 



I cannot be more thankful to my family for the love and support I got. My Ma, for being such a kind and loving mother and for being such a huge part in my life. My Baba, for being the biggest influence in my life and being always there for me. Most of my personal traits, love for science, painting, games, science fiction novels, comics, and countless other things I inherited from him. I am grateful to my parents for providing me with an amazing childhood and always putting the value of education above everything. Similar goes for my paternal grandparents for ball their love and care. Dida, my grandmother, for being such an inspirational woman in my life, and dadu, my late-grandfather, who inspired and shaped my childhood. My late-maternal grandparent for being a crucial part of my childhood. Going to their place during my childhood is still vivid, and so are many holidays in distant places in India. I miss all of them dearly. You would have been proud. Chod-dida and chor-dadu for their love. I remember the weekends I spend at their place on Saturdays after the masters' entrance examination preparation classes.



Finally, I cannot finish this chapter without thanking my girlfriend, Monika Kos, for her unconditional love, kindness, compassion, and support. For sanding alongside me in good times and in bad times, especially those never-ending deadlines. We met with unexpected tragedy in our life. The long-distance relationship, frequent traveling between Z\"urich and Zagreb, and the Covid situation was tolling for both of us. Yet, she never lost hope. She is my constant source of inspiration and joy.
