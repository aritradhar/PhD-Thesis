A few months back, I watched a video where former California governor and former bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger wa delivering a speech at University of Huston a few years back. Where he said that self-made man or woman is a myth. No one is truly self made as our journey is supported by countless help and kindness. I could not agree to this statement more. Which is why I would like to take some time to thank so many people for my unforgettable PhD journey.

The biggest impact during my PhD was made by my adviser Dr. Srdjan Capkun both professionally and personally. I can not thank him enough for his continuous support and guidance throughout past years. He gave me immense freedom to explore the topics that I am truly passionate about. He guided me when I did not know what to do with that freedom. I was always amazed by his mentoring skill and I tried to imitate some of his techniques while supervising students. Srdjan has a unique way to have a create bond with his PhDs and Post Docs that made him popular among his students. The numerous discussion I had with him not only about my work, but my personal life had a profound effect towards aligning my viewpoints. %The short day trip we had in California during NDSS 2020 was memorable\footnote{specifically because of the apple pie in Julian}.
