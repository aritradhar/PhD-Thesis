A few months back, I watched a video where former California governor and former bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger wa delivering a speech at University of Huston a few years back. Where he said that self-made man or woman is a myth. No one is truly self made as our journey is supported by countless help and kindness. I could not agree to this statement more. Which is why I would like to take some time to thank so many people for my unforgettable PhD journey.

My adviser Dr. Srdjan Capkun, for his continuous support and guidance throughout past years. He gave me immense freedom to explore the topics that I am truly passionate about. For his guidance when I did not know what to do with that freedom. Over the time, I also got the opportunity to have personal conversation with him outside the PhD research and I always enjoyed those anecdotes.
