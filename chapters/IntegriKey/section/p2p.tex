\section{Peer-to-peer secure messenger}
\label{sec:p2p}

We additionally design a peer-to-peer secure messenger application based on the
secure hub. The secure hub establishes an end-to-end secure channel (\tls)
between two hubs by leveraging the \webusb and \webrtc protocol. The \webrtc
protocol establishes communication between two browsers. Using this channel, the
secure hubs two end points can establish a secure channel and the malicious host
would be completely oblivious (\dy{Is this true? I think the OS still knows some
meta data. Or perhaps you assume some CoverUp-like solution deployed here?}) of
any communication between two such secure hub devices.

\dy{Good start, let's add mention some more explicit security properties as goals in the problem statement. We'd have to also talk about \webrtc in the background now. Regarding ``secure hub'' We'll need to fix the name some time. Let's think about this along with the name for \tool}
