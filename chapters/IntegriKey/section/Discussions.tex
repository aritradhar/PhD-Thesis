We now discuss various aspects of \tool.

\subsection{Alternative Solutions}

In Section~\ref{sec:fieldSwap}, our main challenge is that the server and the \device cannot actively detect such an attack since they have no information about what the compromised host system is displaying to the user. One trivial solution is to introduce a dedicated display unit on the \device that shows the true label of a selected field, allowing the user to verify the label they see next to the text field on the display. However, since we aim to introduce minimal or no changes to the user's behavior, introducing a separate display would significantly increase the user's cognitive load.
