\label{sec:conclusion_promimitee}

Relay attacks have been known for a decade, but their implications to modern TEEs like SGX have not been carefully analyzed. In this chapter, we have presented the first such analysis and shown that attestation redirection increases the adversary's ability to attack an attested enclave. We have also proposed \name as a solution to prevent relay attacks using proximity verification. Our experimental evaluation is the first to show that proximity verification can be made secure and reliable for TEEs like SGX. As an additional contribution, we have also presented a novel boot-time initialization solution for addressing a stronger emulation attacker who has leaked attestation keys.
