    \caption[Disaggregated architecture similar to dReDBox project]{\textbf{Disaggregated architecture similar to dReDBox project~\cite{dis1}.} The figure shows an example disaggregated architecture similar to dReDBox project~\cite{dis1} that are common in modern data centers. Rather than fully-fledged computers, the architecture employs different racks - compute, memory, storage etc. Inside this racks, there are multiple special purpose SoC-based microservers that are called bricks. These bricks have communication ports to talk to other bricks over fast optical circuit switches.}
