\section{Conclusion} 
\label{integriscreen:sec:conclusion}

In this chapter, we explore the idea of \emph{visually supervising} user's IO data to provide IO integrity against a compromised host. We use a smartphone to capture the client's screen and enforce the integrity of the web rendered on the screen, alongside the input data the user submits on the web form. We show the feasibility of this approach by developing a fully functional prototype on an Android smartphone, evaluating it with a series of experimental tests, and running a user study to measure participants' responses to simulated attacks.
Considering the rapid increase in processing power and camera quality of smartphones, but also novel platforms such as augmented reality headsets and smart home assistants, we envision such systems that supervise user's IO will be ubiquitous.
